This is the beginning stages of a react app to show case a minimum amount of code with a programming language of my choice.

I decided on React because of a few reason. Its isolated debugging capabilities. It's used for most mobile apps, and web platforms. As a developer, coding in React makes you better at JavaScript which is a language used by 90% of web development today.

On this app is information about an Apprenticeship and when it starts and finishes Program from April 24, 2023 - November 3rd, 2023. There is also one link that provides good information on react itself "https://reactjs.org".

I look forward to adding more to this repo.
