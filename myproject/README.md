APPRENTICE-APRIL23
MYPROJECT

This is the beginning stages of a react app to show case a minimum amount of code with a programming language of my choice and comfort level. In this app I added Functional Components and Class Components to export and import the return of html or in this case jsx. I focused on the basic of react when it came to these two components. I added a Components folder in which I worked out of by added two other js files "Greetings & Message." This made things easier since they are in the same directory to import. I added a const name to show a little more of the jsx when adding my name to the app. 

Also, on this app is information about an Apprenticeship and when it starts and finishes from April 24, 2023 - November 3rd, 2023. There is one link that provides good information on react itself "https://reactjs.org".

I decided on React because of a few reason. Its isolated debugging capabilities. It's used for most mobile apps, and web platforms. As a developer, coding in React makes you better at JavaScript which is a language used by 90% of web development today. React is more on the friendly side due to it being used to design the interface. I love the fact that you may reuse code as much as you want because it is components based.

This is and npm start app so it will run in the browser under http://localhost:3000.  If you decide to take this app further just remember you will see the changes automatically as you change the code. If you want to stop the app from running just type ^C and that will stop it.
There is so much that can still be done and I look forward to adding more to this repo. Thank You!
